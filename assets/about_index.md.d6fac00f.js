Thanks for the visit!</p><p>I&#39;m a Chemical Engineer in the process of changing jobs into the IT world. Currently I&#39;m studying System Analysis and Development and diving into front-end development. I really appreciate the collaborative environment that is created in several different platforms online, where we can learn and share. This is really special for me, because the majority of my knowledge comes from free online sources, such as free ebooks, videos, blog posts and programming exercises.</p><p>Speaking of programming exercises, I&#39;d like to highlight the quality and positive impact that <a href="https://www.exercism.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exercism</a> has in my growth as a developer. I have used the platform since 2019, when I was learning my first concepts of programming with Python. Exercism is a great and free way to receive feedback from other developers throught mentoring sections. Later on, I moved to the Java track and today I mentor other students myself, which is a great experience. There is no better way to learn a concept than by explaining it to others.</p><p>This collaborative environment is also very evident in open-source iniciatives. I&#39;m currently contributing to <a href="http://exercism.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exercism.io</a> and I plan to expand my contributions to other projects soon.</p><p>The more I learn about programming and software development, the more I realize the infinitude of topics that envolve these areas. There is always more to discover, and I&#39;m excited to everyday step a bit further into this world.</p>',6),i=[n];function s(c,h,l,d,m,p){return r(),t("div",null,i)}var _=e(a,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,_ as default};
